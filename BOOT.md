# Dope Boot Document

This is the session router for repository-aware work in jfin602/dope.

Before substantial repository-aware planning, implementation, review, architecture work, roadmap work, or documentation changes:

1. Read this file.
2. Read AGENTS.md.
3. Read the narrowest relevant current docs.
4. Inspect current source and tests before making implementation claims.

## Current state

Dope is a fresh repository at package version 0.0.0.

No product implementation has been qualified yet.

The current engineering gate is:

**Foundation Spike 0 — Theia substrate qualification**

Initial spike pin:
- Eclipse Theia 1.75.0;
- desktop target: Electron;
- Node baseline for the spike: Node 24 major;
- Linux desktop packaging is required;
- Theia AI is optional future infrastructure behind a Dope adapter, not a product model.

The spike exists to try to break the Theia thesis before Dope becomes deeply coupled to it.

Foundation Spike 0 qualifies the IDE substrate only. It must not grow model integration, Agent Mind execution, tool execution, AI mutation, scoped delegation, or ambient intelligence merely to exercise future architecture.

Historical planning source:
- docs/foundation-context.md

If the historical source conflicts with a later current contract, the current contract wins and the conflict should be resolved explicitly.

Current authority:
- docs/VISION.md
- docs/PRINCIPLES.md
- docs/PRODUCT-MODEL.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/THEIA-SPIKE.md
- docs/project-overview.md
- docs/workflow.md
- docs/stability-contract.md
- docs/roadmap/mvp-roadmap.md
- docs/planning/foundation-spike-0/decision-record.md
- docs/planning/foundation-spike-0/qualification-plan.md
- docs/decisions/0004-model-provider-independence.md

## Product premise

Dope is an AI-native software development environment in which the programmer remains the protagonist and AI amplifies the programmer's existing abilities.

> At the end of a four-hour session, the developer should understand the software better than they did when they started, while accomplishing dramatically more than they could alone.

> The environment should ensure that the understanding survives the session.

Dope should feel like an exoskeleton for programming, not a replacement programmer.

The fundamental interaction unit is the development session, not the prompt.

## Initial roadmap

The initial sequence is intentionally small:

Foundation Spike 0 — qualify Theia
-> Phase 1 — IDE Alive
-> Phase 2 — Project Mind
-> Phase 3 — Planning
-> Phase 4 — AI Presence
-> Phase 5 — Scoped Delegation
-> Phase 6 — Development Sessions

Do not pull later-phase concepts forward merely because they already exist in the long-term product model.

## Product shape

BUILD includes editor, terminal, debugger, tests, source control, runtime, agent execution when delegated, and code review.

THINK includes notes, ideas, questions, research, decisions, plans, architecture, and exploration.

These are different views into the same project state.

The intended knowledge lifecycle is:

Observation -> Idea -> Explore/Research -> Decision -> Plan -> Task -> Implementation -> Validation -> Project Knowledge

## Locked architecture direction

Theia is the initial IDE/workbench substrate.

The product architecture is not "Theia IDE + plugins."

Current/early layers:

Dope desktop / Theia workbench
-> Dope presentation adapters and widgets
-> Application / orchestration
-> Project Intelligence / Planning
-> Persistence adapters

Later AI layers:

Agent Runtime
-> Model Runtime / Tool Runtime / Authority
-> provider and execution adapters

Project Intelligence, Planning, and later Agent Runtime remain presentation-independent.

Theia AI may be used selectively behind an adapter when AI Presence is implemented. Theia AI agent/chat abstractions do not define Dope's product domain.

## Project Mind

Project Mind is the developer-facing durable project memory.

Project Intelligence is the internal domain/service boundary that implements it.

Initial Project Mind scope begins with:
- Note
- Idea
- Question
- Decision

Later phases add Plans, Tasks, Agent Mind, DeveloperSession, ChangeSet, Validation, Research, and ArchitectureModel according to the roadmap.

Chat is one interface for manipulating project state. Chat history is not canonical product state.

## Model and provider independence

Dope is not married to any model, model family, provider, hosted service, local runtime, or provider-native chat/session format.

First-class compatibility targets include:
- OpenAI / ChatGPT / Codex
- local models and local inference runtimes
- future providers through replaceable capability-based adapters

No provider owns Project Mind, Planning, Agent Mind, Sessions, Authority, Decisions, or Validation.

The current GPT-6 Sol/Codex repository workflow is a development-tooling choice, not Dope's runtime architecture.

## Authority

When mutation-capable AI is introduced, models do not receive direct filesystem/process mutation authority.

AI -> ProposedAction -> Authority/Permission Layer -> ToolExecutor -> effect

Observation and mutation permissions are distinct.

Human, AI, and shared ownership may differ across portions of one task.

This is a future product invariant, not a Foundation Spike 0 implementation requirement.

## Relationship to George

Dope is not George v2.

There is no compatibility requirement with George.

George is useful prior art for repository workflow, the prompt/task runner, local model integration, tools, approvals, permissions, observability, context/recovery, validation, and benchmarking.

Do not inherit George's TUI-first or agent-first product architecture.

## Workflow

Documentation:

/docs-review -> explicit approval -> /docs-apply

Implementation:

/prompt-ass -> /prompt-plan -> /prompt-write <folder>

> Plan richly; prompt sparsely; validate rigorously.

New implementation prompts use GPT-6 Sol Medium by default, GPT-6 Sol High for materially harder/riskier work, and GPT-6 Sol XHigh only exceptionally.

Foundation Spike 0 uses task folder p0 and package versions 0.0.x. The ported runner has explicit Phase 0 support.

## Immediate next action

Do not start broad product implementation.

The Foundation Spike 0 prompt stack now exists under `docs/tasks/p0`.

Validate and execute it through the normal phase runner, honoring the P4, P5, and P7 browser/GUI handoff gates.

Phase 0 should prove only:
- serious IDE basics
- custom Dope UI/layout
- typed frontend/backend seams
- minimal Dope-owned persistence
- restart restoration
- customization/rebinding
- extension/tooling compatibility
- Linux packaging
- one Theia upgrade

The spike must qualify or reject Theia before Product Phase 1 begins.
